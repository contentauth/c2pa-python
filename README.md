# C2PA Python library

The [c2pa-python](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-python) repository provides a Python library that can:
- Read and validate C2PA manifest data from media files in supported formats.
- Create and sign manifest data, and attach it to media files in supported formats.

Features:

- Create and sign C2PA manifests using various signing algorithms.
- Verify C2PA manifests and extract metadata.
- Add assertions and ingredients to assets.
- Examples and unit tests to demonstrate usage.

## Prerequisites

This library requires Python version 3.10+.

## Package installation

Install the c2pa-python package from PyPI by running:

```bash
pip install c2pa-python
```

To use the module in Python code, import it like this:

```python
import c2pa
```

## Examples

See the [`examples` directory](https://github.com/contentauth/c2pa-python/tree/main/examples) for some helpful examples:
- `examples/sign.py` shows how to sign and verify an asset with a C2PA manifest.
- `examples/training.py` demonstrates how to add a "Do Not Train" assertion to an asset and verify it.
