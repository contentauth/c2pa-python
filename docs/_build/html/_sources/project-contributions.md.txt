# Contributing to the project 

The information in this page is primarily for those who wish to contribute to the c2pa-python library project itself, rather than those who simply wish to use it in an application.  For general contribution guidelines, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Setup

It is best to [set up a virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html) for development and testing:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate the virtual environment.

- On Windows:
    ```bash
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
- On macOS/Linux:
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

Load project dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

Download library artifacts for the current version you want, (for example, as shown below for v0.55.0):

```bash
python scripts/download_artifacts.py c2pa-v0.55.0
```

Install the package in development mode:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

This command:

- Copies the appropriate libraries for your platform from `artifacts/` to `src/c2pa/libs/`
- Installs the package in development mode, so you can make changes to the Python code without reinstalling.

## Building wheels

Build the wheel for your platform (from the root of the repository):

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m pip install build
pip install -U pytest

python3 -m build --wheel
```

To test local wheels locally, enter this command:

```bash
make test-local-wheel-build
```

To verify the builds, enter this command:

```bash
make verify-wheel-build
```

## Testing

The project uses [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/) and [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) for testing.

Run tests by following these steps:

1. Activate the virtual environment: `source .venv/bin/activate`
2. (optional) Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the tests:
    ```bash
    make test
    ```
5. Alternatively, install `pytest` (if not already installed) and run it:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    pytest
    ```
    **Warning**: Using `pytest` can lead to issues if you often switch between virtual environments.

### Testing during bindings development

While developing bindings locally, we use [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html), since [PyTest](https://docs.pytest.org/) can get confused by virtual environment re-deployments (especially if you bump the version number).

To run tests while developing bindings, enter this command:

```sh
make test
```

To rebuild and test, enter these commands:

```sh
make build-python
make test
```
